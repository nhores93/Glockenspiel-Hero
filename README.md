# Glockenspiel-Hero
A Glockenspiel is a musical instrument that has a set of keys, similar to a piano, except that rather than use strings, it uses the natural vibrations of metal plates. 

This program accepts musical notes as command line arguments and converts them to their sound frequencies in order to play music. There are two modes of operation: song mode and game mode. The user may either choose to play a song or play a game that allows them to guess the notes in the song without the octave number. If the guess is correct the next note is played and they are prompted to continue guessing. They have 3 guesses before the game terminates. 


Text files with song names and notes are included as sample command line inputs.
